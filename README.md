Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington. The company originally started as an online marketplace for books but gradually expanded its offerings to include a wide range of product categories. This diversification led to it being referred to as "The Everything Store".

Data Loading and Preparation
The analysis begins with loading a dataset containing information about various Amazon products and their associated profits. Data preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. Key steps include calculating the total profit for each product category and sorting the data to highlight the most and least profitable categories.

Visualization of Profits by Category
To visualize the profitability of different product categories, a bar chart is created. This chart provides a clear, visual representation of which categories contribute the most to Amazon's profits. The categories are sorted in descending order, making it easy to identify top and bottom performers.
